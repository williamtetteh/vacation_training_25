             Noodles are a versatile and comforting staple food made from unleavened dough, typically crafted from wheat, rice, or other grains, and shaped into long, thin strands. They can be boiled, stir-fried, or served in soups, absorbing flavors from broths, sauces, and seasonings to create endless varieties of dishes. With their soft, chewy texture and ability to pair well with vegetables, meats, and spices, noodles are enjoyed worldwide in countless culinary traditions from Asian stir-fries and ramen bowls to Italian pasta dishes.

     <h3>How to Make Noodles:</h3>
      <p>

       <li>Fill a large pot with water and use lots of water so the noodles can move freely, about 1 Litter of water per 100 g of pasta is a good rule of thumb.</li>

       <li>Bring to a rolling boil.</li>

       <li>Salt the water by adding salt once the water boils. Salt it well — roughly 1 to 2 teaspoons per litre (or about 1 tablespoon for a large pot). This flavors the noodle itself.</li>

       <li>Add the noodles: Drop them in, stir immediately so they do not stick.</li>

       <li>Boil, stirring occasionally, use the package time as a guide. Start tasting 1 to 2 minutes before the lower end of the range. You want al dente (firm to the bite), unless a softer texture is desired.</li>

       <li>Reserve cooking water, before draining, scoop and keep about 100 to 250 ml (half to 1 cup) of the starchy cooking water — it is magic for loosening and binding sauces.</li>

       <li>Drain and then pour into a colander. Do not rinse unless the recipe specifically asks for it (rinsing removes surface starch and cools the noodles).</li>

       <li>Finish in the sauce (recommended): Transfer drained noodles to a pan with your sauce over medium heat. Toss for 1 to 2 minutes with a splash of reserved cooking water until the sauce clings to the noodles. Serve immediately.</li>
      </p>
     <h3>Quick variations / special noodle types</h3>


      <h4> Ramen / Curly Instant Noodles:</h4>

       <p> 

       <li>Boil 500 ml of water add noodles, cook 2 to 4 minutes, add seasoning packet at the end (or make your own broth).</li>

       </p>

       <p>

       <h4> Fresh egg noodles: </h4>

      </p>

     <p>

    <li>They cook very fast, usually 2 to 4 minutes. Use the same boiling method but check early.</li>

    </p> 

    <p>

      <h4> Rice noodles (thin):</h4>

    </p>
    <p> 
    <li>Often work best by soaking: soak in warm water 5 to 10 minutes until pliable, then briefly blanch in boiling water 30 seconds to 2 minutes. For thicker rice noodles, soak 20 to 30 minutes or follow package instructions. Rinse with cold water to stop cooking if using in a cold dish or stir-fry.</li>
   </p>

   <p> 

<h4>Soba (buckwheat noodles):</h4>
<li> Boil 4 to 7 minutes (check package), then drain and rinse quickly under cold water if eating cold; if serving hot, toss briefly in hot broth or sauce.</li>
</p>

<p>
    <h4>Stir-fry finish:</h4>
    <li> Par-cook (to just under al dente), drain, then add to the hot wok/pan at the end with sauce — toss quickly over high heat so noodles pick up smoky “wok hei.”</li>

</p>

<p>
    <h3>Common Pitfalls</h3>

</p>
<p>
<li>Do not add oil to the water, it can prevent sauce from sticking.</li><br>

<li>Stir early and occasionally to avoid clumps.</li><br>

<li><h5></h5>Taste test</h5>: It is the most reliable way to judge doneness.</li><br>

<li>Use reserved cooking water to loosen and emulsify sauces (starchy water or glue).</li><br>
</p>

<p>
    <li> watch for steam and splashing hot water when draining.</li>
</p>

<p> 
  <li>  cooked noodles keep 3 to 4 days refrigerated in an airtight container; toss with a little oil to prevent sticking.</li>
