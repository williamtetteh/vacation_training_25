           <h3>How to Make Popcorn:</h3>
     <ol>
      <li>Place a large pot with a tight-fitting lid on the stove and add the oil. Heat on medium.</li>
      <li>Add three popcorn kernels to the pot and cover with the lid.</li>
      <li>When those test kernels pop, add the rest of the 1/3 cup kernels in an even layer. Cover again.</li>
      <li>Shake the pot gently so kernels stay in an even layer and don't burn. Keep the heat at medium.</li>
      <li>As the kernels begin to pop, gently lift and shake the pot occasionally so unpopped kernels fall to the bottom.</li>
      <li>When popping slows to about 2 to 3 seconds between pops, remove the pot from heat and keep the lid on for a minute to let remaining pops finish.</li>
      <li>Carefully remove the lid (watch for steam), pour popcorn into a large bowl, and season with salt, melted butter, or other toppings.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Safety Tips When Making Popcorn:</h3>
    <p>
    <ol>
    <li>Always use a pot with a tight-fitting lid to prevent hot oil from splattering.</li>
    <li>Do not overheat the oil — keep the heat on medium to avoid burning.</li>
    <li>Wear oven mitts when handling the pot, as it can get very hot.</li>
    <li>Be careful when lifting the lid — hot steam can cause burns.</li>
    <li>Never leave popcorn unattended while it is popping, as it can burn quickly.</li>
    <li>Keep children away from the stove or microwave while making popcorn.</li>
    <li>Allow the popcorn to cool slightly before eating to avoid burning your mouth.</li>
